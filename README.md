# Radon-Monitoring-For-Earthquake-Surveillance-Using-Machine-Learning-Methods
Natural disasters like earthquakes have the potential to seriously affect both human life and property. By considering the parameters that affect radon concentration in soil, various machine learning algorithms are used to predict the anamolous behavior of radon in soil,before and after the occurrence of seismic events.
